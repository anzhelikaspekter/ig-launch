                    <p class="card__desc">An ICO is a method of raising capital for cryptocurrency projects in which
                        companies issue and sell their own tokens in exchange for investment. This process allows
                        startups
                        to raise funds quickly, bypassing traditional financial institutions, and gives investors access
                        to
                        promising new cryptocurrencies. ICOs are also called lunchepads - IG Launch actively
                        participates in
                        lunchepads. Earnings on lunchepads can reach up to 300% per year. After all, we are talking
                        about
                        investing in a company at the embryo stage, which can be equated to the construction of a
                        multi-storey building, in which not even the ground floor is built! Investing at the very
                        beginning
                        is always a profitable investment. We analyse projects in depth to avoid the risk of a startup's
                        collapse.</p>

                    <p class="card__desc">An IPO is a process whereby a private organisation offers its shares for sale
                        to
                        the general public on the stock market for the first time, giving investors a stake in the
                        company
                        and the right to a share of its profits. IPOs are highly regulated, require significant cost and
                        preparation, and are usually targeted at large institutional investors. Unlike institutional
                        investors, the key to our team's success lies in the speed of decision-making. The faster the
                        buying
                        decision is made, the bigger the earnings - this is our main motto.</p>

        <p class="info__desc">*The main advantage of the chosen methods of raising capital is that the company gets
            resources to scale, and the investor gets an opportunity to buy shares or tokens at a low price. As the
            company grows, their value increases, which benefits both parties.</p>
